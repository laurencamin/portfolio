    <!-- My Journey -->
    <section class="more-about">
      <h2>My Journey</h2>
      <p>
        My journey to become a Software Developer began when I entered a design sprint during the 
        COVID-19 pandemic. The design sprint required participants to submit ideas to help schools reopen and 
        assist the emotional, mental, and physical health of students, educators, and additional constituents.
        My idea was a software to help recipients ask for assistance from nonprofit organizations without compromising 
        their privacy. After my submission, I discovered my idea was ranked as one of the top ideas in the design sprint.
        The design sprint challenged me to think about how I could use my knowledge and skills to make the world
        a more equitable place for everyone. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Later on, I attempted to create the software by using no-code and low-code software. However, I 
        realized I wanted to add more functionality to the software and needed additional training to do so.
      </p>
      <p>
        After completing a software engineering bootcamp, I have acquired skills in using
        JavaScript, HTML, CSS, React, MongoDB, Mongoose, and Node.js.
